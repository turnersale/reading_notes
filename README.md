# Reading Notes
This repository is dedicated to my note taking for books across many topics. The primary topics are related to computer science and data science, but will only contain books related to management and leadership, all the way to physics or psychology.

Pleasure reading is not included in this repository, as note taking is not pleasurable for me.

If you have a book that you would like to add to this repository, please see the template.readme file for the general formatting used in my notetaking and make sure that your notes are in a similar format. I am happy to bring more cliff notes in if the books are of interest to me and they the notes are easily read. Feel free to do a pull request and I will get back to you ASAP.

## Setup
Each set of notes takes the last name of the first author (if multiple authors are included) and a somewhat simplified name of the book (if needed) for the naming convention. It is not particularly precise, but the metadata below should help in finding the book you are looking for.

In addition to a markdown file of notes (markdown is used for portability and can be easily converted to docx or html if desired), there is a reading list below that shows the books that are completed and metadata such as authors, ISBN, tags and publication date. This list is not the only one though, as I also have a list of books that I am currently reading as well. This list will look much the same, and as books are completed they will be transferred to the completed list.
